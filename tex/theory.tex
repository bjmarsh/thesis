\chapter{The Standard Model and Beyond}
\label{chap:theory}

The Standard Model of particle physics is a quantum field theory describing all
known fundemental particles and the interactions between them (with the exception
of the gravitational force). Developed over decades in the latter half of the 20$^\mrm{th}$
century, it has predicted experimental findings to an extraordinary degree of accuracy,
and represents one of the crowning achievements of modern science.
However, despite it successes, there are a number of known phenomena that cannot be
explained with the current theory, giving physicists reason to look for an expanded model.
In this chapter, we outline the Standard Model as it currently exists, discuss some
of the challenges that the model faces, and give a brief survey of proposed extensions to
the Standard Model that are relevant to this thesis.


\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}

The Standard Model (SM) is at its core a quantum field theory defined by a local 
$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry. We will explain what exactly this means shortly 
(basically, each term gives rise to one of the three fundamental interactions), but for now we simply
describe all of the known particles and their properties.

      consisting of six quarks (purple) and six leptons (green), 
      and divided into three generations. There are additionally four force-carrying vector bosons (spin-1),
      that couple to the fermions and give rise to the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.
      Finally, the scalar Higgs boson, proposed in 1964 and discovered in 2012, provides the mechanism
      by which the other particles acquire mass. (Taken from \cite{SM_diagram})

\subsection{Fundamental particles}

Figure~\ref{fig:sm} shows all distinct particles in the SM, organized into groups.
On the left, in purple and green, are the 12 fundamental fermions, defined by the
value of their intrinsic angular momentum, or ``spin'', of \nicefrac{1}{2} (in units
of $\hbar$). By the spin-statistics theorem, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle,
meaning no two can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

The fermions are further defined by the various charges they carry (which determine how they
interact with the bosons, as we will see). In green are the six leptons, three with electric charge
of $-1$ (electron, muon and tau) and three that are electrically neutral (electron neutrino, muon
neutrino, and tau neutrino). In purple are the 6 types of quarks. The up-type quarks (up, charm, and top)
have electric charges of $+2/3$, and the down-type quarks (down, strange, and bottom) have electric
charges of $-1/3$. The quarks, in contrast to the leptons, carry color charge, meaning they
can interact via the strong interaction. All quarks and leptons carry weak isospin, meaning they can interact
via the weak interaction. Each of the fermions also has a corresponding antiparticle, which has the same
mass but inverted charges.

The fermions can be classified into three generations as indicated in the diagram, with masses
increasing in each generation (with the possible exception of the very light neutrinos, whose
masses are not precisely known). Due to various conservation laws arising from the allowed 
interactions, the first-generation particles are all stable, and hence form the building
blocks of matter. The strong interaction allows up and down quarks to strongly bind to
one another, forming protons (two ups and a down) and neutrons (two downs and an up).
The strong interaction further binds these into nuclei, which themselves bind to electrons via the electromagnetic
interaction to form atoms.

Moving to the right in the diagram, in red we have the four gauge bosons, which have spin-1
and which mediate the fundamental interactions. Their integer spin means they obey Bose statistics,
and are not constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle as are fermions. 
The gluon is massless, electrically neutral and mediates the strong
interaction. The photon is also massless and neutral and mediates the electromagnetic interaction. Finally,
the $W$ and $Z$ bosons area massive and mediate the weak interaction, and carry electric charges of $\pm1$.
